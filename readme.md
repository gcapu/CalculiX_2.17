# CalculiX_2.17

Just a repo with most of the source code available in http://www.dhondt.de/

## About this repo

This repo is not official. If you are looking for the official repo check these two

https://github.com/orgs/calculix/repositories

https://github.com/GeneralElectric/CalculiX

For some reason, the official repos there don't contain the latest version and I'm adding it here just for me to have it. 
Some of the files are compressed because they were too large.
